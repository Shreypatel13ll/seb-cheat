## SEB Cheat

This GitHub project that exploits SEB security and allows you to bypass the system of Safe Exam Browser (SEB) and open new tabs by pressing CTRL+Tab or ALT+Tab. 

### Introduction

SEB is a secure browser used for conducting online exams. It restricts the user's access to other applications and websites while taking an exam. However, some users may want to open new tabs to access additional resources during the exam. This script provides a workaround for that.
